Certain characters, currently the double-quote and the backslash, may
   not be sent as-is inside a quoted string.  These characters must be
   preceded by the escape character if they are in a quoted string, or
   else the string must be sent as a literal

 The CR and LF characters may be sent ONLY in literals; they are not
   allowed, even if escaped, inside quoted strings.

   And while we're talking about special characters: the IMAP spec, in
   the section titled "Mailbox International Naming Convention",
   describes how to encode mailbox names in modified UTF-7 [UTF-7 and
   RFC-2060].

The server should maintain UIDs permanently for all messages if it
   can.  If that's not possible, the server must change the UIDVALIDITY
   value for the mailbox whenever any of the UIDs may have become
   invalid.

UIDs are not unique between mailboxes; they are only unique
   WITHIN a given mailbox.

 When a client asks for certain information in a FETCH command, the
   server may return the requested information in any order, not
   necessarily in the order that it was requested.  Further, the server
   may return the information in separate FETCH responses and may also
   return information that was not explicitly requested (to reflect to
   the client changes in the state of the subject message

 Some back-end mail stores keep the mail in a canonical form, rather
   than retaining the original MIME format of the messages ...also may mean that the server has no convenient
   way to know the RFC822.SIZE of the message

If the server allows multiple connections to the same mailbox, it is
   often possible for messages to be expunged in one client unbeknownst
   to another client : RFC2180

Many implementers of both clients and servers are confused by the
   "reference name" on the LIST command.  The reference name is intended
   to be used in much the way a "cd" 
Server implementations must implement the reference argument in a way
   that matches the intended "change directory" operation as closely as
   possible

To repeat: a server should use "/", "\", or "." as its hierarchy
   delimiter.  The use of any other character is likely to cause
   problems and is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.
