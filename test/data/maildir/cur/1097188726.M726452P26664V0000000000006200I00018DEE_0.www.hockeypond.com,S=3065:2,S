Subject: San Jose Sharks Chat Registration


Thank you for registering for the Sharks chatroom on sjsharks.com.  
You will need to login each day to post.  As long as you don't fully 
exit your computer, you will not need to login again during that day.

Below is your registration information.  If you lose your information, 
please contact chatmaster@www.sjsharks.com from your email address and 
your password will be emailed back to you.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USERNAME IS YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS BELOW. YOUR HANDLE
WILL AUTOMATICALLY POPUP WHEN YOU POST TO THE CHAT ROOM.

We hope you enjoy the Sharks chatroom.

Below is a copy of the terms & conditions that you agreed to:

Any use of profanity, sexual innuendos, personal attacks or racial 
slurs will result in an automatic banning from the chatroom.  Common 
sense will tell users words and phrases that are inappropriate.  The 
substitution of symbols and punctuation for letters will be 
considered the same as typing the complete word.  Use your better 
judgment and dont make the Webmaster be your judge.  It would simply 
take too much to list every possible offense, so consider this your 
notification for everything.

There is no warning system or appeal process for those who cross the 
line.  This is not a penalty that will differ from poster to poster.  
Everyone will be subject to the same penalties.  Therefore, if it might 
be offensive to others, rewrite your opinion.

The chatroom is for your use as the arena is.  Just remember that you 
can't say anything you want in a public place without facing possible 
ramifications.  In the chatroom you now know the ramifications.

Should Sharks management deem other actions necessary, your email 
provider may be notified of your postings and legal action may be 
considered.
